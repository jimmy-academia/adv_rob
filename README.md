### 2024-10-23
(in screen run) => run 75 epoch, look if adv_acc go up and then down
next steps: step size scheduling (use ttt), ??


### 2024-10-02

breakthrough this week!!!
- -> running AT cifar10 mobilenet @solid [firsttime] --> up to 0.35 adv acc
- -> write/run AST cifar10 mobileapt patch 1

### 2024-09-30

[plan]
- follow chatgpt and initialize code
- test run 
- start initial full run
[result]
- ...
[TODO]
- ...

### 2024-09-23
- initialize new repository

[TODO]
1. basic modualization... a) interchange training method (ipt and other at, quantization methods) vs models vs datasets vs attacks
2. setup list of models and start
